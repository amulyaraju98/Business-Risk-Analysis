# Transaction And Customer Concentration Analysis For Risk‑Aware Decision Making
This project analyzes transaction and customer data to identify where revenue and activity are concentrated across customers, products, and time. The main goal is to help the business or risk team understand which segments, categories, and periods are most important, so they can prioritize monitoring and controls in those areas.

## Findings:
- **Customer Segments:** Identifying which customer groups bring in the most revenue and are the most active, so they can be closely monitored.
- **Product Categories:** Determining which products generate the highest revenue and are most popular, guiding inventory and marketing strategies.
- **Time Periods:** Revealing when revenue is concentrated (such as certain months, days, or hours), highlighting periods that need extra risk management.
- **Payment Methods and Purchase Patterns:** Showing which payment methods and purchase frequencies contribute the most to revenue, supporting operational decisions.

# Conclusion:
By focusing on these high-impact segments and critical periods, the project helps the business protect revenue, manage risks, and ensure resilience. The findings guide targeted marketing, inventory management, and proactive risk mitigation, making the business more effective and secure.
